# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

Week 3 Notes: <https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/journal/week3.md>

## Cognito Errors

Received the following error when trying to signup.

```sh
InvalidParameterException: Username cannot be of email format, since user pool is configured for email alias.
```

This was because I had left the following option checked.

> Allow users to sign in with a preferred user name
