# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

Week 3 Notes: <https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/journal/week3.md>

## Cognito Errors

Received the following error when trying to signup.

```sh
InvalidParameterException: Username cannot be of email format, since user pool is configured for email alias.
```

This was because I had both username and email in the following option. Only email should have been checked,

## Observations

My local development system is a lot less forgiving than Gitpod.

If the following function does not exist then React will not load locally displaying the following error.

```sh
setCognitoErrors("Email is invalid or cannot be found.")   
```

![React Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5746804/223359323-8841126f-8d08-4af0-b7bd-0158fb997efd.png)

To resolve this the function needs to be renamed to setErrors. The same issue does not occur on Gitpod.
