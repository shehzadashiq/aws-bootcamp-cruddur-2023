Sharp Documentation: <https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install>

```

## Issue when creating Serverless Image Process

When creating the lambda, I face a few errors. Because of costs I had been working off my local machine. This installed sharp but once the lambda had been uploaded it would complain that sharp was missing. I resolved this by switching over to Gitpod

Once this issue had been resolve the lambda would still not trigger. I checked that the code was correct by testing it against sample JSON. This passed so I looked into various aspects in the cloudformation stack. I looked at the roles in cloudformation and saw the following error.

This however was a red herring and wasted time. The reason for the code not working was that there were typos in the .env file. The lambda was looking at

```sh
avatar/original
```

while the image was being uploaded to

```sh
avatars/original
```

Once this was resolved the lambda processed images successfully.

## Dynamically passing user handle to profile

This makes the Profile Icon handle dynamic by removing @andrewbrown as a hardcoded URL.

In DesktopNavigation.js the following is hardcoded

```sh
profileLink = <DesktopNavigationLink 
      url="/@andrewbrown" 
      name="Profile"
      handle="profile"
      active={props.active} />
```

During my video grading Andrew mentioned that since the user had been already passed we should be able to access the property of it. A bit of trial and error later the following code works.

```sh
profileLink = <DesktopNavigationLink 
      url={"/@" + props.user.handle}
      name="Profile"
      handle="profile"
      active={props.active} />
```

This shows the @bayko profile when logged in as Bayko

Initially double clicking on this caused an error as it kept appending the username to the end of the URL repeatedly. I managed to resolve this by appending / at the beginning of the URL which I had missed out initially.

I also wrote this up in a Blog post to provide more detail.

## Creating S3 Upload

npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3 --save

<https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3#getting-started>


## Ruby

To initialise ruby in a directory run the following command

```sh
bundle init
```

To install the packages in a ruby bundle run the following command

```sh
bundle install
```

UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME needs to be configured as a GitPOD environment variable

```sh
gp env UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME="tajarba-uploaded-avatars"
```

Test Ruby function by running

```sh
bundle exec ruby function.rb
```

## Code to dynamically get the GitPod name in Ruby

```rb
workspace_id = ENV['GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID']
workspace_cluster_host = ENV['GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST']

workspace_url = "https://#{workspace_id}.#{workspace_cluster_host}"

puts "Workspace URL: #{workspace_url}"
```

## Repo for JWT Token
https://github.com/awslabs/aws-jwt-verify

npm install aws-jwt-verify --save

## CORS Not Working

Following the videos and looking through the discord, I cannot get CORS working.

Currently I have had to disable the CruddurApiGatewayLambdaAuthoriser completely :(
