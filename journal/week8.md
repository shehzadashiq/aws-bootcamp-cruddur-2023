## Issue when creating Serverless Image Process

When creating the lambda, I face a few errors. Because of costs I had been working off my local machine. This installed sharp but once the lambda had been uploaded it would complain that sharp was missing. I resolved this by switching over to Gitpod

Once this issue had been resolve the lambda would still not trigger. I checked that the code was correct by testing it against sample JSON. This passed so I looked into various aspects in the cloudformation stack. I looked at the roles in cloudformation and saw the following error.

This however was a red herring and wasted time. The reason for the code not working was that there were typos in the .env file. The lambda was looking at 

```sh
avatar/original
```

while the image was being uploaded to 

```sh
avatars/original
```

Once this was resolved the lambda processed images successfully.

## Dynamically passing user handle to profile

This makes the Profile Icon handle dynamic by removing @andrewbrown as a hardcoded URL. 

In DesktopNavigation.js the following is hardcoded

```
profileLink = <DesktopNavigationLink 
      url="/@andrewbrown" 
      name="Profile"
      handle="profile"
      active={props.active} />
```

During my video grading Andrew mentioned that since the user had been already passed we should be able to access the property of it. A bit of trial and error later the following code works.

```
profileLink = <DesktopNavigationLink 
      url={"@" + props.user.handle}
      name="Profile"
      handle="profile"
      active={props.active} />
```

Currently double clicking on this causes an error but I will see if I can resolve this.
