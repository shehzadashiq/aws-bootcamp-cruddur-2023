## Issue when creating Serverless Image Process

When creating the lambda, I face a few errors. Because of costs I had been working off my local machine. This installed sharp but once the lambda had been uploaded it would complain that sharp was missing. I resolved this by switching over to Gitpod

Once this issue had been resolve the lambda would still not trigger. I checked that the code was correct by testing it against sample JSON. This passed so I looked into various aspects in the cloudformation stack. I looked at the roles in cloudformation and saw the following error.

This however was a red herring and wasted time. The reason for the code not working was that there were typos in the .env file. The lambda was looking at 

```sh
avatar/original
```

while the image was being uploaded to 

```sh
avatars/original
```

Once this was resolved the lambda processed images successfully.
