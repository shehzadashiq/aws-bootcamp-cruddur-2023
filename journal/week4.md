Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager is convenient to use.

Had a problem with the db-schema-load script. I had the following

```sh
$echo $schema_path
```

instead of

```sh
echo $schema_path
```

This gave me errors when trying to output the path. I thought there was something wrong with my environment instead of a typo.
