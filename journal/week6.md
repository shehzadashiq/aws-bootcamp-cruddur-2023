## Migrate existing domain to Route 53

My existing domain is with ionos.co.uk, I have pointed the name servers to Route 53 however the change takes 48 hours.

Migration worked within ionos but domain was no longer pingable. Creating the aliases to the ALB's resolved this issue.

The application is now accessible via the domain name and the migration has been successful.
