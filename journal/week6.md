## Configuring WSL2 to work using Windows Credentials

I had an earlier version of Git Installed. This was not able to pass the required credentials to WSL2. This meant I would have to configure WSL2 with a separate key. I did not want to do this as GIT can use Windows Credentials.

To take advantage of this feature I upgraded my existing Git Installation using WinGet 

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
```
I then configured WSL2 to point to my Windows credential store using the following command.

```sh
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/bin/git-credential-manager.exe"
```

## Migrate existing domain to Route 53

My existing domain is with ionos.co.uk, I have pointed the name servers to Route 53 however the change takes 48 hours.

Migration worked within ionos but domain was no longer pingable. Creating the aliases to the ALB's resolved this issue.

The application is now accessible via the domain name and the migration has been successful.
